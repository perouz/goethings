# Geothings

Geothings is meant to become a set of Python tools for performing discrete geometric reconfigurations.

It is a personal tool, in the sense that its main purpose right now is to help me understand the behavior of some of the geometric reconfiguration problems I have been working on.

I plan to eventually add some visualization that will help visualize the operations. 


### Disclaimer
I do realize that many of the classes/functions I will be developing already exist in disparate Python libraries. I have nevertheless consciously chosen to re-implement some of them.
