# Geothings

Geothings is meant to become a set of Python tools for performing discrete geometric reconfigurations.

It is a personal tool, in the sense that its main purpose for now is to help me understand the behavior of some of the geometric reconfiguration problems I have been working on. 

For more information on these problems see [my publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=LJ7gHkQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Support for operations such as pops, flips, flipturns, deflations, etc. will eventually be added.

(I do realize that a subset of such functionality already exists in disparate Python libraries. I have nevertheless consciously chosen to re-implement some of them.)
